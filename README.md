## Running the tests

The tests for this library are written in [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com), which we install using [Bower](http://bower.io/). From the root of the repository in a terminal window, run `bower install` to download and install jQuery and QUnit. Then open [tests/qunit-tests.html](tests/qunit-tests.html) to run the tests.
